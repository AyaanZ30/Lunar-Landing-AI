# Lunar-Landing-AI
An AI project demonstrating the power of the Deep-Q Learning technique to train an AI-agent for maximizing it's reward/score and successfully playing the Lunar Landing game(gymnasium) using a brain of it's own/functioning of a neural network.

This Notebook implements a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to simulate the lunar landing process. The project aims to train an agent to successfully land a spacecraft on the lunar surface by optimizing its actions based on the state of the environment. The key features and components of this notebook include:

Environment Setup: Configuration of the lunar landing simulation environment using OpenAI Gym.
Neural Network Architecture: Implementation of a neural network to approximate the Q-value function.
Experience Replay: Utilization of a replay buffer to store and sample experiences for training.
Training Loop: Iterative process to train the agent by interacting with the environment and updating the neural network.
Evaluation: Assessment of the trained agent's performance through simulation runs.

The notebook provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm, including code, explanations, and visualizations to demonstrate the learning process and results.
